%FINDAVESPECTURM  This function could be used as means of frequency domain
%   noise calibration.

%   Simply put, it would record background audio when no drones were
%   present, then use the collected data to determine the background
%   spectrum, and how much this spectrum tended to change (with
%   varianceVector).
